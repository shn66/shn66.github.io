  pages={5267--5272},
  abstract={We propose a Model Predictive Control (MPC) for
collision avoidance between an autonomous agent and dynamic
obstacles with uncertain predictions. The collision avoidance
constraints are imposed by enforcing positive distance between
convex sets representing the agent and the obstacles, and
tractably reformulating them using Lagrange duality. This
approach allows for smooth collision avoidance constraints
even for polytopes, which otherwise require mixed-integer
or non-smooth constraints. We consider three widely used
descriptions of the uncertain obstacle position: 1) Arbitrary
distribution with polytopic support, 2) Gaussian distributions
and 3) Arbitrary distribution with first two moments known,
and obtain deterministic reformulations of the collision avoidance constraints. The proposed MPC formulation optimizes
over feedback policies to reduce conservatism in satisfying
the collision avoidance constraints. The proposed approach is
validated using simulations of traffic intersections in CARLA.},

  abstract={We propose a Stochastic MPC (SMPC) approach for autonomous driving which incorporates multimodal, interaction-aware predictions of surrounding vehicles. For each mode, vehicle motion predictions are obtained by a control model described using a basis of fixed features with unknown
weights. The proposed SMPC formulation finds optimal controls which serves two purposes: 1)
reducing conservatism of the SMPC by optimizing over parameterized control laws and 2) prediction and estimation of feature weights used in interaction-aware modeling using Kalman filtering.
The proposed approach is demonstrated on a longitudinal control example, with uncertainties in
predictions of the autonomous and surrounding vehicles.},

  url={arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.00060},
  booktitle={2023 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium},
  abstract={Motion planning for autonomous vehicles sharing
the road with human drivers remains challenging. The difficulty
arises from three challenging aspects: human drivers are 1) multimodal, 2) interacting with the autonomous vehicle, and 3) actively
making decisions based on the current state of the traffic scene.
We propose a motion planning framework based on Branch
Model Predictive Control to deal with these challenges. The multimodality is addressed by considering multiple future outcomes
associated with different decisions taken by the human driver.
The interactive nature of humans is considered by modeling them
as reactive agents impacted by the actions of the autonomous
vehicle. Finally, we consider a model developed in human
neuroscience studies as a possible way of encoding the decision
making process of human drivers. We present simulation results
in various scenarios, showing the advantages of the proposed
method and its ability to plan assertive maneuvers that convey
intent to humans.},

  abstract= {We propose a supervised learning framework for computing solutions of multi-parametric Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) that arise in Model Predictive Control. Our approach also quantifies sub-optimality for the computed solutions. Inspired by Branch-and-Bound techniques, the key idea is to train a Neural Network/Random Forest, which for a given parameter, predicts a strategy consisting of (1) a set of Linear Programs (LPs) such that their feasible sets form a partition of the feasible set of the MILP and (2) a candidate integer solution. For control computation and sub-optimality quantification, we solve a set of LPs online in parallel. We demonstrate our approach for a motion planning example and compare against various commercial and open-source mixed-integer programming solvers.}

The nominal dynamics are assumed to be difference flat, i.e., the state and input can be reconstructed using flat output sequences. For the considered class of systems, we synthesize Robust MPC policies and show how to use historical trajectory data collected during iterative tasks to 1) obtain bounds on the unmodelled dynamics and 2) construct a convex value function approximation along with a convex safe set in the space of output sequences for designing terminal components in the Robust MPC design. We show that the proposed strategy guarantees robust constraint satisfaction, asymptotic convergence to a desired subset of the state space, and non-decreasing closed-loop performance at each policy update. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy on a minimum time control problem using a constrained nonlinear and uncertain vehicle model.",

Using the self-similarity and locality preserving properties of Hilbert's space filling curve, a set of evasive maneuvers are prescribed and characterized for online implementation. Application of these maneuvers in the case of non-uniform coverage of spaces and for obstacles of varying sizes is also presented. The results are validated with representative simulations demonstrating the deployment of the approach.},

  abstract={This article studies the dynamics and control of a novel underactuated system: a ball and plate system suspended by a team of quadrotors via cables. The plate is sought to be horizontally stabilized at a certain height, with the ball stabilized at the center of mass of the plate. The freely moving ball adds 2 degrees of underactuation to the system. The design proceeds through a decoupling of the quadrotors and the plate dynamics. Through a partial feedback linearization approach, the attitude of the plate and the translational height of the plate is initially controlled, while maintaining a bounded velocity along the y and x directions. These inputs are then synthesized through the quadrotors with a backstepping and timescale separation argument based on Tikhonov's theorem.},
