## Spacecraft Formation Control in Presence of Communication Delays

In this work, we consider a spacecraft formation problem wherein there are asymmetric, bounded and time-varying delays in the communication links between the spacecraft while the feedback from the spacecraftâ€™s own states is instantaneous. This project was done under the guidance of Prof. Kamesh Subbarao during my internship at The University of Texas at Arlington in the summer of 2016. More details can be found in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01185">paper</a> presented at the 27th AAS/AIAA Spaceflight Mechanics Meeting 2017.



## UAV Circumnavigation in GPS-Denied Areas

In this work, we designed a class of control laws to achieve circumnavigation in a GPS-denied environment using range and range-rate information. Unlike earlier works, the control laws presented are non-switching and continuous. Owing to the bounded nature of the control law, a limit on the gain is derived to account for turn rate limitations. This work was done under the guidance of Prof. Ashwini Ratnoo during my internship at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore in the summer of 2015.
