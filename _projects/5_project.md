Space-filling curves are primarily used in applications that require visiting various regions in a space. In this work, we address tracing the Hilbert's space-filling curve in regions with obstacles. Using the self-similarity and
locality preserving properties of Hilbertâ€™s space filling curve,
a set of evasive maneuvers are prescribed and characterized
for online implementation. Using depth-first search over differnt resolutions of Hilbert's space-filling curve, we propose an algorithm for non-uniform coverage of spaces with obstacles of varying sizes.
