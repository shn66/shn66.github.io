Hi! I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student majoring in Controls at the Model Predictive Control Laboratory, UC Berkeley. I am advised by Prof. [Francesco Borrelli](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/francesco-borrelli/).


My research focuses on developing (1) robust, (2) data-driven, and (3) computationally efficient algorithms for nonlinear MPC by using tools from nonlinear control, optimization and machine learning.


Prior to joining UC Berkeley, I received my Bachelor's and Master's degree from IIT Bombay in 2018 where I was fortunate to have been advised by Prof. [Ravi Banavar](https://sites.google.com/view/ravibanavar/home) and Prof. [Arpita Sinha](https://sites.google.com/iitb.ac.in/arpitasinha).

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.test

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
